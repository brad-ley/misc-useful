# misc-useful
Useful epr code

## PlotGUI
This is designed for users to plot any given data file -- can be csv, dat, tab or space separated txt, etc.
Users can stack plots, average similarly-named files, create multiple plots in UI window, and export to csv using pyqtgraph built in export option by right-clicking on plot window
Now has a feature that opens a subwindow for exporting the created plot's csv to a matplotlib png.

## others
Pretty self-explanatory code for reformatting & plotting .dat files from the epr spectrometer.

### installation
git clone github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful and run your file of choice in python 3 (preferably *Anaconda* distribution to save pip installing all dependencies).
