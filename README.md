Useful epr code

## plot_gui
This is designed for users to plot any given data file -- can be csv, dat, tab or space separated txt, etc.
Users can stack plots, average similarly-named files, create multiple plots in UI window, and export to csv using pyqtgraph built in export option by right-clicking on plot window
Now has a feature that opens a subwindow for exporting the created plot's csv to a matplotlib png.


## csv_fig (This is now deprecated)
Not great implementation, but user can create a nice .png figure from the exported .csv through plot_gui. Requires easygui.

### installation
git clone github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful and run plot_gui_v3.py, assuming the necessary dependencies are installed.
