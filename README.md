Useful epr code

# plot_gui
This is designed for users to plot any given data file -- can be csv, dat, tab or space separated txt, etc.
Users can stack plots, average similarly-named files, create multiple plots in UI window, and export to csv using pyqtgraph built in export option by right-clicking on plot window
Just download python file, ensure required python modules are installed, and it will run on it's own

# csv_fig (This is now deprecated)
Not great implementation, but user can create a nice .png figure from the exported .csv through plot_gui. Requires easygui.

## installation
git clone github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful and run plot_gui_v3.py
